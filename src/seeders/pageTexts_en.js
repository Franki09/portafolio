My day-to-day revolves around bringing modern, functional, and well-structured interfaces to life. Beyond code, what drives me most is thinking about how every detail can improve the user experience and make a website intuitive and enjoyable to use.",

I deeply value teamwork because I believe the best projects come from combining different ideas and perspectives. I enjoy working in agile and dynamic environments where I can grow professionally and contribute not only technically, but also personally.",
      3: "I’m currently looking to keep evolving as a professional, face new challenges, and, above all, add value to every project I’m involved in. For me, every line of code is an opportunity to learn, improve, and create something that truly makes a difference.",
